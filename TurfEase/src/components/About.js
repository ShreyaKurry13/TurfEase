            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <hr className="mb-4" />
            <p>
              The idea behind TurfEase was born in early 2024 when a group of sports enthusiasts struggled to find a reliable way to book turf grounds for evening matches. We noticed how frustrating it was to call turf managers, confirm availability manually, and often face last-minute cancellations or miscommunications. What started as a simple Excel sheet and WhatsApp group for turf availability quickly evolved into a vision ‚Äî to digitally transform turf booking in India.
            </p>
            <p>
              By mid-2024, we began developing the platform using React.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL as our core database. Our goal was to make the process fast, transparent, and fair for both players and turf owners. We officially launched our beta version in early 2025 with a small set of partners in Maharashtra. Positive feedback and real-world use helped us refine our features ‚Äî including real-time slot availability, secure online payments, and smart filters. Today, TurfEase continues to grow, empowering local players, turf managers, and sports organizers through a tech-enabled booking solution built for the future of Indian sports.
