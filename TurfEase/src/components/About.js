          <hr />
          <p className="text-muted">
            The idea behind TurfEase was born in early 2024 when a group of sports
            enthusiasts struggled to find a reliable way to book turf grounds for
            evening matches. From a simple Excel sheet to a powerful web app,
            TurfEase has grown into a game-changer for the Indian sports community.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted">
            We launched our beta in early 2025 with partners in Maharashtra,
            continuously improving based on real-world feedback.
