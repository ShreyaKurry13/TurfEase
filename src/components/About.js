              <h2>Our History</h2>
              <div class="aboutdivider mb-4"></div>
              <p>
                The idea behind TurfZone was born in early 2024 when a group of
                sports enthusiasts struggled to find a reliable way to book turf
                grounds for evening matches. We noticed how frustrating it was
                to call turf managers, confirm availability manually, and often
                face last-minute cancellations or miscommunications. What
                started as a simple Excel sheet and WhatsApp group for turf
                availability quickly evolved into a vision ‚Äî to digitally
                transform turf booking in India.
              </p>

              <p>
                By mid-2024, we began developing the platform using React.js for
                the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL as our core
                database. Our goal was to make the process fast, transparent,
                and fair for both players and turf owners. We officially
                launched our beta version in early 2025 with a small set of
                partners in Maharashtra. Positive feedback and real-world use
                helped us refine our features ‚Äî including real-time slot
                availability, secure online payments, and smart filters. Today,
                TurfZone continues to grow, empowering local players, turf
                managers, and sports organizers through a tech-enabled booking
                solution built for the future of Indian sports.
